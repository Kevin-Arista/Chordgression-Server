# Proof-of-Concept

`webscrape.sh` contains a shell script that demonstrates the principles of web scraping.

Web scraping is the concept the automated abstraction of data from websites without neccessarily rendering the HTML on the browser manually. There a multiple ways to accomplish this. One of the most straight forward ways, is by using your terminal, with commands like `curl` on Linux. The basic shell script abstracts the author's username from a guitar tutorial on [Ultimate Guitar](www.ultimate-guitar.com).

NOTE: the web scraping done here and in any other place throughout the project folder is not for commercial purposes and in bona fide intentions for the sake of exploring/demostrating how web scraping works.
